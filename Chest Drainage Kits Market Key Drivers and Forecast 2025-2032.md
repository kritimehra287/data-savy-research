This growth is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer, which often require chest drainage procedures. Additionally, the rising number of thoracic surgeries and advancements in minimally invasive surgery techniques are contributing to the demand for more efficient chest drainage solutions. The global aging population and the need for better healthcare infrastructure, especially in emerging economies, are also key factors propelling market expansion. The introduction of advanced chest drainage systems with enhanced safety features, such as one-way valves and automatic suction control, is expected to further boost market growth. Furthermore, the growing focus on improving patient outcomes and reducing post-operative complications is encouraging hospitals and healthcare centers to adopt state-of-the-art chest drainage kits. Another notable trend is the increasing number of outpatient procedures and home-based care for patients recovering from chest surgeries, which drives the demand for portable and easy-to-use drainage kits.
